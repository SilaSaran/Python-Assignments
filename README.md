# Python-Assignments

Assignment1: Python Fundamentals.

The assignment involes writing Python code to practice fundamental concepts such as variable definition, arithmetic operations, f-strings, escape sequences, and user input. These exercises help develop basic coding skills, including printing outputs, converting values, and creating interactive programs.

Assignment2: Data structures in python. 

The assignment covers fundamental data structures in Python, including lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples, with practical exercises to create, modify, and manipulate these structures.

Assignment3: Conditional and Looping Statements.

This assignment involves writing Python programs for various tasks like determining the month based on a number, calculating ticket costs based on age, computing BMI and weight status, finding the greatest of three numbers, and determining factorials and reversed numbers using loops. It also includes interactive programs for patterns, looping conditions, and the classic FizzBuzz problem to enhance logic and programming skills.

Assignment4: Python-Functions

This assignment focuses on Python concepts including the use of len() to find the length of a list, creating a greet(name) function for personalized greetings, and writing a find_maximum(numbers) function without max(). It also covers the difference between local and global variables, along with default arguments in the calculate_area() function.

Assignment5: File and Exception handling.

This assignment contains Python programming exercises focusing on file operations, exception handling, and arithmetic computations. These exercises are designed to strengthen fundamental programming skills while introducing intermediate concepts.

Assignment6: OOPS

In this assignment writing a program to manage a university's course catalog using a base class Course, along with subclasses CoreCourse and ElectiveCourse, each with distinct attributes (required_for_major and elective_type) to represent mandatory and elective courses.
Created a Python module named employee, defining an Employee class with methods for accessing attributes (name and salary), and import it into a separate program to display employee information effectively.

Assignment7: Numpy_Pandas

This assignment involves working with NumPy and Pandas libraries in Python to perform essential data manipulation tasks. 
The exercises include creating and reshaping arrays, filtering data, and managing series and dataframes, such as adding columns, filtering rows. 
Exporting the dataframe to a CSV files then read that CSV file and display its contents.
